## Creative Coding + AI II: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

started with changing what was dawn to arcs and parallel lines, its giving looking out the window on  a rainy day

making ideas - taking a while


no texture coming throug normal photo

what i actually wanna do?
draw photo first, then misstext spawn from center and start spreadng outwards to bounds of mask - some going horizontally outwards like glitch lines


can make as many js files as i want, be clear which one I want graded in readme n stuff


Actual code
- started by drawing misstext in backgraound, then pointilism pixels drawing in the unmasked areas, first black, then the actual image

- did 'scanning' by lin which converted the original image t orderly and evenly spaced pixels - then misstext would fill in the masked area i the same scanning way


to do 
- just make a test image and mask thing with single blobs to test out code
